## About Me

My name is Li WenKang(李文康). You can call me K(^_^). I was born in 1996.

I am an IT noob focusing on web technology.

I have a Bachelor of Engineering, and once worked for a robot lab in my college as a developer in software and hardware.

In spare time, I like reading book, surfing internet, listening music and having hot pot with my friends.
